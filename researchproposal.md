Final: Research Proposal - DATA150 

Disasters bring havoc amongst communities, whether its human-made disasters or natural disasters, and create a serious impediment on the lives of people when not properly dealt with. With disaster management, societies can properly prepare and respond to disasters by efficiently and strategically organizing resources to lessen harm. Prevention includes reducing potential damage that disasters cause including raising awareness about hazards and installing prediction and warning systems. Preparedness includes prior planning such as creating procedures and designating responsibilities. Response and recovery include delivering help and supporting communities as they rebuild such as setting up shelters, and distributing emergency supplies. These four components of disaster management, prevention, preparedness, response and recovery, uniquely aid in emergencies to save lives and reduce suffering. Having a solid, global-perspective understanding of what disaster prevention is will assist in comprehending how Japan goes about their disaster management methods (Tulane). Over the centuries, Japan has experienced many disasters and understood the importance of efficient emergency response and preparedness training. (EPS). The country has familiarized itself and its citizens with concepts and principles of crisis management so they can respond to urgent situations quickly and effectively (Tulane). Meticulously examining The Great East Japan Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami was just the beginning to solving my primary research question, “How do we use data science to better disaster management and response to tsunamis in Japan?”. My reviews and investigations were constructed to better understand the different data science methods created as solutions in the result of the disaster. By examining the social media analytics behind the evacuation of the tsunami and the infrastructure of the MOWLAS S-net consequently built, I was able to get an insight to how these data science methods came about.

This image represents a simplification of the process of disaster management in Japan. The yellow “Early warning” is the part of the circle which the miscalculation spawned in regards to the 2011 Tohoku catastrophe; an underestimated magnitude resulted in an early evacuation prediction causing the deaths of about twenty thousand people. Relating to my previous two data science methods I examined, social media falls under the “Responses” and “Support affected people” category (dark red, top right). My first data science method, regarding the constructed S-net, falls under the light green bottom right “Recovery and reconstruction” area. (Bousai) This MOWLAS observation network is a system for continuous monitoring, but I would suggest a physical, risk-resilient critical infrastructure durable enough to handle tsunami waves and earthquake tremors. The S-net is placed in the ocean, so I would suggest applying data science to the architecture of a newly-built seawall in order to lessen the death toll from Japan’s natural disasters. 
According to a New York Times article, this earthquake has made Japan reconsider its previous heavy reliance on a smaller wall that could not properly hold up against the massive tsunami waves of 2011 (Onishi). I would assume this is why Japan has turned to monitoring networks rather than relying on infrastructure, but I believe that although the S-net has been extremely successful, a physical structure would enhance Japan's already thorough disaster management even more. 
To start answering my main research question, “How do we use data science to better disaster management and response to tsunamis in Japan?”, I would have researchers gather information as to why the tsunami was able to overcome the already existing seawalls. Although height was a clear factor in the protection failure, were there other architectural aspects of the wall that could have been made better so that the death toll could have been lesser? All in all, these questions aim to figure out the main reason why the design of the tsunami countermeasure failed. This would take a timespan of about one year to properly collect the information. After this, architects can capitalize on what exactly went wrong. By harnessing data from the built environment, Japan can make more significant and procedural improvements. (Daniel)
After Japan faced the disaster and the seawalls crashed down, they started to build a 14 foot high cement seawall, but it never really took into account the outspoken concerns and wishes of some groups of people. For example, scientists have argued that the concrete barriers will damage marine ecosystems (Kurtenbach). Citizens have complained that it brings a jail-like environment and it acts as a cutoff to the “Pride of Our Community”: Oya Beach. Fishermen are worried about their livelihoods being at risk with this wall. One of the purposes of my research proposal is to utilize data science methods to rid of these problems that exist because of the newly yet ignorantly constructed wall (Craft). 
The last two years of the time horizon would consist of actually applying these renovations to the wall. First off, small “windows” can be applied to the walls for the fisherman that require a means of living; if a tsunami were to interact with this wall a small (stable) hole scattered across the walls would not affect homes that much. Stairs can be built across the wall and a guard could be hired to keep watch of people that cross in and out the wall. This way, Japanese citizens would not be able to complain about seeing Oya Beach. Saving ecosystems is unfortunately more of a complex problem to solve. Data analytics can help the environment and ecosystems by capturing real-time data and providing highly accurate forecasts and predictions. If there were to be observations built specifically near the wall, I would say they would have to be a small-scale version of the S-net. 
For Amartya Sen, human development meant the consistent expansion and enlargement of the people’s opportunities all while removing people’s unfreedoms. Working to understand previous data science methods in conjunction with my new research proposal works towards bringing about any complications and hindrances, a component of freedom that citizens are deprived of when subjected to danger due to mispredictions of these tsunamis and earthquakes. My research methods aim to rid of Japan’s inconveniences. 
I believe that funders would be sold on the fact that my research plan does not involve completely building this Great wall of Japan, rather, it involves reconstructing it. Therefore, they would not have to spend any more billions of dollars than the ones that were already spent constructing the original wall. Additionally, reconstructing now will prevent possible costs as a result of people's complaints from the original wall being built. For example, if the wall were never to be rebuilt, negative externalities from ecosystem destruction could have been even more costly in the long run. At the maximum one billion dollars should be spent; this budget considers not only modifying the wall, but also hiring the construction workers to do the job on the wall. One thing funders should also consider is the massive amounts more of money that was spent on building the S-net. Not only was money profusely spent, but so much time and effort was put into creating the seafloor observation system. The wall is a tangible and simple method of protection in Japan that I was never able to explore in the past papers due to the S-net’s complexity, and I think that if funders understood how much more efficient and practical the Great Japan Wall is, they would understand why it makes sense to spend billions of dollars creating it. 
	In order to grasp a better understanding of disaster management in Japan, I placed my focus and research on one singular event: the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami. I understood how the tragic events came about, how citizens responded and reacted to the event, and how scientists had utilized data science to prevent this in the future. All while knowing that Japan has experienced countless natural disasters due to its geographical location, it really is impressive how much Japan has went through. All the bibliographies, methods, and reviews helped me gain a better understanding of disaster management and response in Japan and so I was able to come up with this research plan as a result. Although I recognize that this is not a thorough plan, I feel like there are many other parts to this research proposal that can actually be applied properly. I cannot wait to keep up with Japan’s progress.
