1. What was Hans Rosling's observation regarding his comparative survey of students at the Karolinska Institute and the Chimpanzees (as well as the faculty who decide the Nobel Prize)? What is the significance of the results from his informal survey on preconceived ideas?

- He realized late at night that these students technically knew statistically less about the world than chimpanzees after giving the students a pre-test in order to test their knowledge before the course. He saw that the average was 1.8 right (give or take .4) out of 5 points possible, whereas the chimpanzees would on average score 2.5 out of 5 if he gave them two bananas with Sri Lanka and Turkey. He did the same test with the faculty who decided on the Nobel Prize, and came to the realization that there was much preconceived ideas, and there really a need to communicate what's happening in these countries to the world and data needs to be more spread.  

2. What type of change took place in Asia that preceded economic growth? Why was this type of change significant?

- Rosling says that Asia went though tremendous social change preceding economic growth. He displays a chart showing UN statistics comparing different country's family size and life expectancies. Starting in 1962, he plays the video in which the years go by and the circles of countries go towards long lives and smaller families, which is good because most countries used to have large families and shorter life spans. He also shows a distribution of the income, and overtime Asia grows out of poverty they endured in the 1960s. 

3. In accordance with Hans Rosling’s TED talk, what is the relationship between child mortality and GDP per capita?

- On the graph, it is shown that the positive linearity is very strong between child survival (%) and the GDP per capita ($). As the GDP per capita increased, the child survival rate actually increased, and this occured for countries of every continent observed with data. 

4. In terms of income distribution, how has the world changed from 1962 until 2003?

- The gap between income distribution amongst countries has gotten smaller from 1962 to 2003. Rosling shows the example in the video comparing the income distribution of China and America. In 1970, China's income distribution was roughly $100 and $50,000, whereas the USA's was roughly $50,000 to 100,000. As the years pass, China's range grows, and China is "overlooking the United States almost like a ghost".

8. What is the significance of how Hans Rosling uses data to describe global human development in terms of very high spatial and temporal resolutions? How does this relate to his previous observation regarding preconceived ideas?

- The significance of how Hans Rosling uses data to describe global human development in terms of very high spacial and temporal resolutions lies in the possibility of getting publicly funded data out into the world. Rosling says that the UN head won't make a searchable format for this information so "peculiar", but he is hopeful in saying it isn't impossible. If this data were to get out into the world, these "preconcieved ideas" he observed the students had would be rid of. 

9. In your opinion, why was Hans Rosling’s work with the Gapminder project significant in contributing towards advancing the intersection of data science and global human development?

- "Gapminder" was a nonprofit venture to write software to link data as he did on the slides he displayed. This is extremely significant because it relates back to one of his main points: to disclose this information to the public eye. The government (both willingly and unwillingly) closes off this kind of information, and in order to proceed in global human development, people need to make informed decisions with this kind of data. "Gapminder" helps people understand through data science.
