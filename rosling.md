1. What was Hans Rosling's observation regarding his comparative survey of students at the Karolinska Institute and the Chimpanzees (as well as the faculty who decide the Nobel Prize)? What is the significance of the results from his informal survey on preconceived ideas?

- He realized late at night that these students technically knew statistically less about the world than chimpanzees after giving the students a pre-test in order to test their knowledge before the course. He saw that the average was 1.8 right (give or take .4) out of 5 points possible, whereas the chimpanzees would on average score 2.5 out of 5 if he gave them two bananas with Sri Lanka and Turkey. He did the same test with the faculty who decided on the Nobel Prize, and came to the realization that there was really a need to communicate what's happening in these countries to the world and data needs to be more spread.  

3. What type of change took place in Asia that preceded economic growth? Why was this type of change significant?

- Rosling says that Asia went though tremendous social change preceding economic growth. He displays a chart showing UN statistics comparing different country's family size and life expectancies. Starting in 1962, he plays the video in which the years go by and the circles of countries go towards long lives and smaller families, which is good because most countries used to have large families and shorter life spans. He also shows a distribution of the income, and overtime Asia grows out of poverty they endured in the 1960s.
